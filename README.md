# A simple UI using YouTube API

This project was created using React.js and axios to consume YouTube API.

## API Key

You will need YouTube API key to be able to test this project. However, it's not present in here.\
To get your own API key, follow this step
- Go to console.cloud.google.com
- Create a new project
- Go to dashboard and select **Enable APIs & services**
- Click on **ENABLES APIS AND SERVICES**
- Search YouTube Data API V3
- Add it to your project

You should be able to get your API key after completing these steps. The next you do is to replace
*your_api_key* inside **video/src/api/axios.js** and it should ready to go. Cheers!!!
